# ðŸš€ Workforce Management API

This is my submission for the **Backend Developer Evaluation Assignment** by Railse.  
It is a Spring Boot (Java 17) based REST API that simulates a workforce task management system with in-memory data storage.

## ðŸ§  Features Implemented

### âœ… Bug Fixes
1. **Task Reassignment Bug**  
   Fixed duplication issue when reassigning a task by reference â€” now previous tasks are marked as `CANCELLED`.

2. **Cancelled Tasks in Fetch API**  
   Modified fetch logic to exclude `CANCELLED` tasks from the response.

### âœ¨ New Features

1. **Smart Daily Task View**  
   Returns:
   - All active tasks within a selected date range.
   - All open tasks started *before* the range but not yet completed.

2. **Task Priority Management**  
   - Add priority (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) when creating a task  
   - Update task priority via PATCH  
   - Filter tasks by priority

3. **Comments & Activity Logs**  
   - Add comments to any task  
   - Automatically logs key events (e.g., priority changes, comments)  
   - View a full task history with comments and activity timeline
